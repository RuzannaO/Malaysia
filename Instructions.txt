Here you can find some useful hints for the GOTCHA use.

1. How to run video quality check?

In order to detect the hidden face emotions, you will need to provide a proper quality video file to GOTCHA. For these purposes we have a video quality check tool, which will help you to adjust your camera properly, so that the face landmark points will be detected by GOTCHA.
Use the green round button at the bottom of the media-player to start the video quality check. If your camera is positioned correctly, you will see all face landmark points, including white points of eye pupils. 
Stop the process by clicking the same green button.

2. How to run audio-video recording?

After checking face landmark points, use the "Record" button at the bottom of the media-player to start AV recording. Stop recording by clicking the same red button.
Wait for the system to inform when it finishes processing of the file. Please note that processing will take some time. A “Done” window will appear, after process completion. You need to press “OK” to proceed with the next recording process.
Please note that when AV recording is finished, a new processed file with "mm-dd-yy-hh-mm.mp4"  format will be available in the "Recordings" folder.  

3. How to run GOTCHA-processing of AV files?

Go to File -> Open file, then open a file with "mm-dd-yy-hh-mm.mp4" format. Please note that processing will take some time.
If you have already processed the file, then there must be a "mm-dd-yy-hh-mm_final.mp4" file. This file will load immediately as no processing will take place. 

4. How to run bulk processing of files in a specific folder?
Go to File -> Open folder, then browse for a folder in which you want to process all the "mp4" type files. The system will look for 'mp4' format video files and start processing them one by one. You will get notified when processing of all videos will be completed.
